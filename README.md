# Wire Mock Extension for MuleSoft

To improve the quality of code as early as possible, we should be able to test services against 3rd party services. From my experience, we do not often get mocking services.
Using this extension, we can introduce quickly and easily new mocks with powerful request matching and response templating. 

I have prepared application using this extenstion that is ready to use.
You can find repository [here](https://github.com/dyeeye/wire-mock-app). It is just a matter of replacing mapping and uploading this to your CloudHub
